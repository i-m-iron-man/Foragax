Foragax is an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) package based on JAX. It provides scalable and efficient ABM simulations by leveraging JAX's automatic vectorization and just-in-time compilation capabilities. The main features of Foragax include:

 - Agent manipulation (adding, removing, updating, selecting, and sorting agents) with just-in-time compilation.
 - Vectorized ray-casting and wall-detection for simulating agents moving in a continuous 2D environment with custom boundaries and obstacles.
 - Tutorials and examples to help users get started with ABM using JAX.
 - Familiar ABM interface for creating and manipulating agents.
